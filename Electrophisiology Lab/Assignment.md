## The answers to the questions given as an assignment regarding the Electrophisiology Lab.

**Q1:** You are doing extracellular recordings, that is, your electrode is placed outside the cell. How would the recordings
differ if you were recording inside the cell? Would the amplitude of the spikes be the same or different? Would the positive 
and negatively charged portions of the recording look the same or different?

___

**Q2:** What causes the spikes that you saw? Specifically, what is occurring when the spike is positive? What is occurring
when the spike is negative? 

**A2:** The spikes are basically caused to the opening and closing of the ion channels in the neurons.

___

**Q3:** Based upon your initial results, are you primarily listening to spikes coming from motor neurons (neurons that tell 
muscles to contract) or to sensory neurons (neurons that send information from the periphery into the brain). Why?

___

**Q4:** What changes would you see in your recordings if you were to blow on the cockroach? Would the changes caused by 
blowing be the result of activity in sensory neurons or motor neurons?

**A4:** There is a change in the frequency of the spike when we blow on the cokroach leg. Initially, there is some noise
in the readings, once we blow on it the number of spikes increases. The change is caused due to the activity in the <> neurons
